# Python-Analysis-of-DELTACORP-AMJLAND
The aim of this project is to make recommendations in relation to the financial health of the stocks of AMJLAND &amp; DELTACORP. In order to do this, the spot prices between 1st April ’19 to 30th March ’20 have been analysed on various Frequencies, so as to find out which investing methodology will work best in ensuring greater returns for the same amount of risk.  Apart from calculating Returns on the aforementioned frequencies, these Returns will also be adjusted with the Treasury-Bill Returns in order to calculate the Excess Returns. This is important as it paints a more realistic picture of the situation and helps an investor in making more informed decisions.   All analysis has been done through extensive usage of Python (using the Numpy, Pandas  and Matplotlib Libraries). The important observations from the analysis are the Annualised Returns of Risk Adjusted Data &amp; Calculations related to the Expected rate of return and the Required rate of return.
